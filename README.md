## [HackeRank Challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/)

### [Plus Minus](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-plus-minus/problem?h_l=interview&isFullScreen=false&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one)
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with  places after the decimal.

### [MinMax - SUM](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-mini-max-sum/problem?isFullScreen=true&h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one)
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

### [Flipping bits](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-flipping-bits/problem?h_l=interview&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&isFullScreen=false&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen)
You will be given a list of 32 bit unsigned integers. Flip all the bits (1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1) and return the result as an unsigned integer.

### [Diagonal Difference](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-diagonal-difference/problem?h_l=interview&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&isFullScreen=false&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen&h_r=next-challenge&h_v=zen)
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

### [Counting Sort 1](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-countingsort1/problem?h_l=interview&isFullScreen=false&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one)
Quicksort usually has a running time of n x log(n), but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster? In general, this is not possible. Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another. A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat n x log(n) (worst-case) running time, since n x log(n) represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element.

### [Pangram](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-pangrams/problem?h_l=interview&isFullScreen=false&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one)
A pangram is a string that contains every letter of the alphabet. Given a sentence determine whether it is a pangram in the English alphabet. Ignore case. Return either pangram or not pangram as appropriate.

[Solution Here](./src/main/java/br/com/lefranchi/hackerrank/Pangrams.java)

### [Permuting Two Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/one-month-preparation-kit-two-arrays/problem?isFullScreen=true&h_l=interview&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=preparation-kits&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-preparation-kit&playlist_slugs%5B%5D=one-month-week-one)
There are two n-element arrays of integers, A and B. Permute them into some A' and B' such that the relation A'[i] + B'[i] >= k holds for all i where 0 <= i < n. There will be q queries consisting of A, B, and k. For each query, return YES if some permutation A', B' satisfying the relation exists. Otherwise, return NO.
